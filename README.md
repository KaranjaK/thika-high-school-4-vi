# Thika High School for the Visually Impaired – Website

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a modern, accessible, and responsive website built for **Thika High School for the Visually Impaired (THSVI)**. The website is designed to provide clear, inclusive, and barrier‑free access to information for students, staff, parents, and the wider community, with a strong focus on **visual accessibility and assistive technology support**.

The application is built using **React 19** and **Tailwind CSS**, following current best practices in web accessibility (WCAG‑aligned), performance, and responsive design.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Provide an **accessible digital platform** for visually impaired users
* Ensure full **screen reader compatibility** (including ChromeVox, NVDA, JAWS)
* Deliver a **fully responsive** experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
* Create a clean, intuitive, and easy‑to‑navigate interface
* Use modern frontend tools for maintainability and scalability

---

## ♿ Accessibility First Approach

Accessibility is a core requirement of this project, not an afterthought.

Key accessibility features include:

* Semantic HTML5 elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`)
* Proper heading hierarchy (`h1` → `h6`)
* High‑contrast color combinations
* Keyboard‑only navigation support
* Screen‑reader friendly labels and ARIA attributes where necessary
* Focus indicators for interactive elements
* Descriptive alternative text (`alt`) for images
* Avoidance of motion that may cause discomfort

The site is tested with assistive technologies, including **ChromeVox**, to ensure content is correctly announced and navigable.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **React 19** – Component‑based UI development
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility‑first styling for responsiveness and consistency
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Application logic
* **HTML5** – Semantic markup
* **Vite** – Fast development and build tooling

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

The website is fully responsive and optimized for:

* Mobile phones
* Tablets
* Laptops
* Large screens

Tailwind CSS responsive utilities are used extensively to ensure layouts adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.
